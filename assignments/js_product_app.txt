1. create a class named 'product' with following members in a separate file
	a. data: name, id, price, description, imagepath
	b. method: print (will return the name, price and description of the product)

2. create an array to store different product objects (do not add any product at this momemnt) in a separate file "repository.js"  const products=[]
3. create some sampple product objects in index.js file
4. add them into the array through a function addProduct. write that in separate file "productManager.js"
function addproduct(productObj){
	//add the product in the array
}
5. iterate through the array and call print() on every product object. write that code in another function showProducts. write that in separate file "productManager.js".
function showProducts(){
	//display the products (name, price and description)
}
6. delete a product from the array (given the product id) - create a function for that. write that in separate file "productManager.js"
function delete(id){
	//delete a product from the array with the given id
}
7. update a product in the array through a function updateProduct [id of the product shoul not be updated]. write that in separate file "productManager.js"
function updateProduct(updated-values,id){
	//search the same product in the array and update the record
}

8. write the code in modular way to run it in Node JS [use common js format]

index.js, product.js, productManager.js [ create a class named ProductManager with methods: showproducts, addproducts, deleteproduct, updateproduct etc.], repository.js
