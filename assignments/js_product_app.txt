1. create a class named 'product' with following members:
	a. data: name, id, price, description, imagepath
	b. method: print (will return the name, price and description of the product)

2. create an array to store different product objects (do not add any product at this momemnt)
3. create some sampple product objects
4. add them into the array through a function addProduct
function addproduct(productObj){
	//add the product in the array
}
5. iterate through the array and call print() on every product object. write that code in another function showProducts
function showProducts(){
	//display the products (name, price and description)
}
6. delete a product from the array (given the product id) - create a function for that
function delete(id){
	//delete a product from the array with the given id
}
7. update a product in the array through a function updateProduct [id of the product shoul not be updated]
function updateProduct(updated-values,id){
